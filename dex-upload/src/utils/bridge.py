"""
Utilities for cross‑chain bridging in the SnipSwap DEX.

This module defines helper functions that will eventually be used to
forward orders or assets to other Cosmos chains.  At the moment we
implement only a stub function that logs the intent to bridge.  In a
real implementation this would construct and broadcast an IBC
transfer or interchain account transaction via the Cosmos SDK or
SecretJS/IBC libraries.

Functions
---------
send_order_to_chain(chain_id: str, order_payload: dict) -> None
    Stub that prints a message describing the bridging request.  In
    production this would create an IBC packet.

# Mapping of chain IDs to hypothetical HTTP endpoints for order bridging.
# In a production environment these would be full RPC or REST URLs on
# the destination chain.  They are provided here as examples to
# illustrate how a bridging call might be performed.  If a chain is
# missing from this map the helper will fall back to simple logging
# without attempting an HTTP request.

    # so clients can provide either value. Secret Network orders stay on chain
    # (no external bridge required), so it is intentionally omitted.

def send_order_to_chain(chain_id: str, order_payload: Dict[str, Any]) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Send an order to another chain via IBC or HTTP bridge.

    This helper attempts to forward the given order payload to a
    configured endpoint for the specified chain.  If a mapping for the
    chain ID is not found the order is logged and no remote call is
    attempted.  If a remote call is made and fails the exception is
    propagated so the caller can decide whether to treat the failure
    as fatal or merely warn the user.

    Parameters
    ----------
    chain_id: str
        The target chain identifier (e.g. ``"osmosis-1"`` or
        ``"shade-1"``).  This value should correspond to the
        destination blockchain where the order will be executed.

    order_payload: dict
        A dictionary containing the order details.  In a real
        implementation this would be serialized and encrypted as
        required by the destination chain's protocol and then sent
        using an IBC transfer or interchain account call.

    Returns
    -------
    Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
        The JSON response from the remote bridge if a call was made,
        otherwise ``None`` if only logging occurred.

    Raises
    ------
    Exception
        If an HTTP request to the remote bridge fails.  The caller
        should catch exceptions and handle them appropriately.
